# Signals

An experimental Rx- and RAC-3.0-inspired FRP framework

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 8.0+

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate SSignalKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

pod 'SwiftSignalKit'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
